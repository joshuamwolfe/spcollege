For this assignment, complete the following:

1. Create a folder called tissue_backend to store your project files.
2. Inside that folder, run the npm-init command to create a new package.json
3. Add a subdirectory under tissue_backend named “app”
4. In your app folder, create a server.js file.
    a. In server.js, create a simple server that listens on port 3000
    b. Just like the photo album application from chapter 4, the tissue application will maintain
    a collection of issues. An issue contains the following information:
        i. Id
        ii. Title
        iii. Status(New, Closed, Resolved)
        iv. Assignee – The person the Issue is assignment to
        v. Created – Date the issue was created
        vi. Updated – Date the issue was last updated
        vii. Details – Details of the issue

c. Modify your server.js to handle two requests. The first request is to retrieve all issues.
Create a fake array of about 5 issues and return the list of issues as json. The second
request will be a post used to create an issue. Modify your server.js to take a post
request containing json for a new issue and add the issue to your array of issues.
